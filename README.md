# Slack Code Challenges Documentation
## Process
A new code challenge will be announced along with the previous challenge's winner. This usually happens on Sunday. You will have at least a week to work on the code challenge. Please give others feedback on their submissions as well.

## Entries
Here's details on how to submit an entry to the weekly code challenge.

1. Develop a function that takes in the parameters and outputs a solution as described in the challenge and tests.
2. Use sample tests to prove that your function works. 
3. Post your solution in the #code-challenges channel using the `code block` button to format your code.
